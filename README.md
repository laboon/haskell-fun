This is just a place to play around with Haskell.

It should be a good way to see what you can do with the language.

bmi.hs = Tells you your BMI and whether you're underweight, overweight, etc.

sort_stuff.hs = Takes a line of input (e.g. "1 7 9 3") and sorts it.

sieve = Takes one argument (max) and determines all prime numbers between 1 and max using the good ol' Sieve of Eratosthenes.

fizzbuzz = Your standard FizzBuzz interview questions, without using list comprehensions.
