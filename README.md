This is just a place to play around with Haskell.

It should be a good way to see what you can do with the language.

bmi.hs = Tells you your BMI and whether you're underweight, overweight, etc.

sort_stuff.hs = Takes a line of input (e.g. "1 7 9 3") and sorts it.

sieve.hs = Takes one argument (max) and determines all prime numbers between 1 and max using the good ol' Sieve of Eratosthenes.

fizzbuzz.hs = Your standard FizzBuzz interview questions, without using list comprehensions.

fizzlc.hs = FizzBuzz with a list comprehension.

knn.hs = A simple version of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

knn2.hs = An improved version of knn with numerous efficiency enhancements.

mandelbrot.hs = Plots out the Mandelbrot set.  Requires gnuplot (install on system + cabal install gnuplot).
