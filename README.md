This is just a place to play around with Haskell.

It should be a good way to see what you can do with the language.

Bmi.hs = Tells you your BMI and whether you're underweight, overweight, etc.

SortStuff.hs = Takes a line of input (e.g. "1 7 9 3") and sorts it.

Sieve.hs = Takes one argument (max) and determines all prime numbers between 1 and max using the good ol' Sieve of Eratosthenes.

Fizzbuzz.hs = Your standard FizzBuzz interview questions, without using list comprehensions.

FizzLc.hs = FizzBuzz with a list comprehension.

Knn.hs = A simple version of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

Knn2.hs = An improved version of knn with numerous efficiency enhancements.

Mandelbrot.hs = Plots out the Mandelbrot set.  Requires gnuplot (install on system + cabal install gnuplot).
